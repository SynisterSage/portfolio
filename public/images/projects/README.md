# Project Images

Drop your locally hosted portfolio screenshots, renders, or artwork inside this folder.
Vite will serve them from `/images/projects/<filename>`. 

For example, the default nodes expect:
  - `/images/projects/fluid-brand.jpg`
  - `/images/projects/poly-dashboard.jpg`

Replace or extend these files with your own images, keeping the filenames in sync with `constants.ts` if you want them to appear automatically in the spatial and document views.
